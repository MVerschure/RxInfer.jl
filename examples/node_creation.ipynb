    "Welcome to the `RxInfer` documentation on creating custom factor graph nodes. In `RxInfer`, factor nodes represent functional relationships between variables, also known as factors. Together, these factors define your probabilistic model. Quite often these factors represent distributions, denoting how a certain parameter affects another. However, other factors are also possible, such as ones specifying linear or non-linear relationships. `RxInfer` already supports a lot of factor nodes, however, depending on the problem that you are trying to solve, you may need to create a custom node that better fits the specific requirements of your model. This tutorial will guide you through the process of defining a custom node in `RxInfer`, step by step. By the end of this tutorial, you will be able to create your own custom node and integrate it into your model."

    "We have now completed our experiment and obtained the posterior marginal distribution for p through inference. To evaluate the performance of our inference, we can compare the estimated posterior to the true value. In our experiment, the true value for p is 0.75, and we can see that the estimated posterior has a mean of approximately 0.713, which shows that our custom node was able to succesfully pass messages towards the `p` variable in order to learn the true value of the parameter."

We can compare the two posterior distributions and observe that they are exactly the same, which indicates that our custom node is performing as expected."
